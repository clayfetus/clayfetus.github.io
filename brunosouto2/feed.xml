Therefore the only purpose of the blockquote is to repeat a snippet of text that the journalist thinks is particularly "important" - but in reality, it's usually their most hamfisted bit of prose and inserting it in large, bold text simply interrupts the reader's flow, or, even worse, spoils part of the article since the blockquote is repeating text that the reader hasn't even gotten to yet. </p> <blockquote> Almost every single publisher in the world uses blockquotes, the worst element ever defined by HTML.
